I'll keep this pretty simple. 
1. Create a new branch for any changes. Label it. Properly note all changes made. If it needs testing, then say that. 
2. Make sure the version number is labelled correctly. Major release, minor release (stable or not), date, edit on date. ex. 1.8b.10.7.1
3. Create a pull request. 
4. Project lead, or some other user will pull it to the master filepath. 

If you have any questions, you can make an issue, or just send an email keeping in mind the community guidelines.
