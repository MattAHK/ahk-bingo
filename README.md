# ahk-bingo

Pending patch notes

Things to add to AHK bingo / update 

1. Performance updates (X)
	Will need to update so that the system just loops through possibilities instead of going through 1000's of if statements
2. Create rules ( )
	Just add to the info button / or text boxes
3. Eliminate duplicates ( )
	maybe there is some built in part of the rand function
	probably just need to look at previous and add 1 or something if the choice is the same
	if choice1 = choice2
		choice2 += 1
	problem with this is that I would have to go through each one (choice 1-25) and change the value if there are duplicates. This could be solved potentially if the performance fix is done first
4. Add seed system	( )
	should display a seed and allow entry of a seed
	need to add an edit field with a button on the first screen to add a seed
	tab 2 should include the seed number at top or botton
5. some sort of checking system ( )
	since decarlos wants to check these somehow, maybe add ticket numbers to a log when you click a token? log should include a copy of your seed
	after you click new it will delete log
6. Add a back button ( )
	add a gTag to the new image. 
	see if there is some way to have variable coordinates
		if so, need to add vTags to the images
		otherwise will need to refer back to specific images
			can probably do this using the seed
7. Transparent images/ tokens to see the selection under the token ( )
	uhhh.. look up transparency?
