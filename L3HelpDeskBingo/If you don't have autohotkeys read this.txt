Hello, 

If you are reading this, then it is already too late. JK
If you are reading this, you need assistance getting bingo.ahk to run. 
1. Drag and drop bingo.ahk onto AutoHotkeyU64.exe
2. The game should now open. 
3. go to https://autohotkey.com/download/
4. click on download autohotkey .zip 
5. install autohotkeys using the installer. 
	You should now be able to double click bingo.ahk to open it each time. 

6. Give me feedback! Thanks!
